Making life easier
==========

If you write manuscripts usind [LaTex](http://www.latex-project.org/), then you must submit unprocessed source code + image files to [arXiv](http://arxiv.org).  The process can be frustrating, and the following tips/tricks have made life easier for us:

1. arXiv does allow you to upload a zip file of all of your files.  I include the following: all tex files, the .bib, .bbl, .bst files if they are custom (e.g., you are using a journal's .bst file).
2. If you are using [natbib](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php), then include the natbib.sty from your system with your upload.  arXiv/natbib is a common source of [issues](http://arxiv.org/help/faq/texlive).
